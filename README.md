# Conversion of leads to customers

X Education has appointed to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The scores must lie between 0 and 100. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.


The tasks to finish in this case study:
- Predicting the lead scores in the range of 0 to 100 for each lead
- Prediction whether the lead will be converted or not
- Getting the __Sensitivity/Recall__ to be more than `80%` as per business suggestions by the CEO

Logistic regression used to predict probabilities and a threshold was decided with the probabilities for deciding the prediction if the lead will be converted or not.
